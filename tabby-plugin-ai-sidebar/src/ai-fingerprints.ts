/**
 * Per-tool screen fingerprints. We run these regexes over the *rendered*
 * text of the last ~40 visible rows of the terminal (no ANSI escapes —
 * xterm.js already rasterised them into characters).
 *
 * Two checks per tool:
 *   - spinner:    matched while the tool is between byte chunks but still
 *                 actively working (rare — most tools tick the spinner
 *                 frame every ~100ms so the byte-rate signal catches them).
 *   - permission: the tool has stopped and is waiting on a yes/no decision.
 *
 * We deliberately do NOT match an "idle prompt" pattern. Claude/codex/aider
 * keep their input box on screen at all times, so an idle-box regex would
 * also fire mid-response. Instead, "idle" is inferred as the residual case:
 * quiet on the wire, no spinner glyph, no permission prompt.
 *
 * Regexes are intentionally loose. If a tool ships a new UI tweak we'd
 * rather miss-classify briefly and recover than false-pin to a stale state.
